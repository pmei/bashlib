 - want to support simple modules for bash code, with dependency declaration and inline documentation
Requirements:
    - clean: Don't ever want to reload code unless we explicitly request that.
    - lightweight: Use simple functions, aim for zero process creation whenever possible.
    - unobtrusive: DO NOT pollute the ALLCAPS region of the env variable namespace.
    - portable: using bash, so that's a restriction, but it should run on Darwin's bash, common Linux flavors, cygwin, etc.
    - robust: absence of this code should cause as little disruption as possible.
    - lucid: usage of this code should be easy to make clear and readable.

None of the existing toolkits I can find out there have all of these, so it's roll-my-own time.
